The MedicationReminder class represents the core of our medication reminder system. It has a method called scheduleReminders() 
which is responsible for setting up reminders. These reminders are scheduled to occur at regular intervals, such as every 8 hours.
 This interval can be adjusted depending on when Sunita needs to take her medications.

When the scheduled time for a reminder arrives, the remindToTakeMedication() method is triggered. 
Currently, this method simply displays a reminder message on the console. 
However, this functionality can be expanded to notify Sunita through other means such as email, text messages, or a dedicated 
smartphone application. This allows Sunita to receive reminders in a way that is most convenient for her.

To initiate the medication reminder system, we call the scheduleReminders() method within the main method. 
This starts the process of scheduling reminders based on the specified intervals.

This basic prototype serves as a foundation for a medication reminder system tailored specifically to Sunita Sharma's needs. 
Additional features can be incorporated to make the system more user-friendly and customizable. For instance, we can add a user 
interface where Sunita can input her medication schedule and preferences. This would allow her to configure the system according 
to her specific requirements.
Additionally, different notification options can be provided to accommodate Sunita's preferences and lifestyle. 
This ensures that she receives reminders in a timely manner, helping her to manage her medications effectively and live a healthier life.
